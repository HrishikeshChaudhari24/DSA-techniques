Rearranging an Array Using In-Place Modulo Encoding
Overview of the Approach:
This approach is based on the mathematical property of modular arithmetic: Dividend = Divisor Ã— Quotient + Remainder. It is a space-efficient technique that allows storing two values at a single index during array manipulation.

The idea is to encode both the old and new values in an array without requiring extra space. By leveraging the properties of modulus and division, we can store two pieces of information at each index and retrieve them later. The method is particularly useful for rearranging arrays where elements need to alternate between the largest and smallest values in a certain pattern.

Key Technique:
Modular Encoding:
At each index arr[i], we store two values:

The original value (as the remainder when divided by a large number max_element).
The new rearranged value (as a multiple of max_element).
This is done using the expression:

arr[i] += (arr[index_to_store] % max_element) * max_element;


Here, index_to_store could be either the index of the largest remaining element or the smallest remaining element depending on whether the current index is even or odd.

Decoding the Values:
After encoding the values during the rearrangement process, the original value can be extracted using the modulus operation:


arr[i] % max_element;

The new rearranged value is extracted using the division operation:


arr[i] / max_element;


Step-by-Step Explanation:
Initialization:
We initialize two pointers, min_idx and max_idx, which track the positions of the smallest and largest remaining elements in the array. We also determine max_element, which is a value larger than the maximum element in the array.

Rearrangement Process:

For even indices, the largest remaining element is stored at the current index.
For odd indices, the smallest remaining element is stored. This is done while updating min_idx and max_idx accordingly.
Final Transformation:
After rearranging the elements using the modular encoding, we decode the new rearranged values by dividing each element by max_element.

Situations Where This Technique Can Be Applied:
In-Place Rearrangement: This technique is ideal when space is a constraint, and you need to rearrange an array without using any additional storage, such as in competitive programming scenarios.

Alternating Patterns: Problems where elements of an array need to be rearranged into alternating patterns (e.g., largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.) can benefit from this approach.

Cyclic Permutations: This approach can also be useful in problems involving cyclic shifts or rotations of arrays, where temporary storage of both the original and rearranged values is needed during the transformation.

Space-Efficient Algorithms: It is well-suited for algorithms where achieving an O(1) space complexity is crucial.

This modular encoding technique provides a clever way to perform complex in-place rearrangements while keeping the code efficient and avoiding the need for auxiliary data structures.
